# Capacitor iOS Setup for ZapArounds

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

Your ZapArounds project has been successfully set up with Capacitor iOS support following the official documentation at [https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins/ios](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins/ios).

## 🚀 Setup Steps Completed

### 1. Core Installation
- ✅ Installed `@capacitor/cli` and `@capacitor/core`
- ✅ Initialized Capacitor in the project
- ✅ Added iOS platform with `@capacitor/ios`

### 2. Configuration
- ✅ Created `capacitor.config.ts` with iOS-specific settings
- ✅ Set app ID: `com.zaparound.app`
- ✅ Set app name: `zaparound`
- ✅ Configured web directory: `dist`
- ✅ Added iOS-specific configurations:
  - Custom scheme: `zaparound`
  - Background color: `#fcfcfc` (following brand guidelines)
  - Content inset: `always`
  - Navigation limits: enabled

### 3. iOS Project Structure
- ✅ Generated native iOS Xcode project in `ios/` directory
- ✅ Set up Swift Package Manager configuration
- ✅ Integrated with existing React + Vite build system
- ✅ Successfully synced web assets to iOS project

## 📱 Current Status

Your project now has:
- **Web**: Full React + Vite functionality (unchanged)
- **iOS**: Native iOS project ready for development
- **Build System**: Integrated Capacitor build process

## 🔧 How to Use

### Development Workflow
1. **Build web app**: `npm run build`
2. **Sync to iOS**: `npx cap sync ios`
3. **Open in Xcode**: `npx cap open ios`

### iOS Development
- Open `ios/App/App.xcworkspace` in Xcode
- Build and run on iOS Simulator or device
- Make changes to web code, rebuild, and sync

## 🎯 Next Steps (When You're Ready)

When you want to add native iOS functionality:

1. **Create Custom Plugins**: Follow the Capacitor plugin architecture
2. **Add Native Features**: Camera, GPS, notifications, etc.
3. **Custom UI Components**: Native iOS views and interactions
4. **Platform-Specific Logic**: iOS-only functionality
